function_pointers
=================

A simple 'application' which shows how to define and use function pointers
in C.
This C program doesn't really make any sense, but proves the point how
cool function pointers are! Yes, I used the word `C` and `cool` in the
same sentence. Deal with it! ;)
```

Driving a Model S with 200.000000 km/h
The Model E has just been announced. It isn't ready yet :(
Driving a Model X with 180.000000 km/h
Sorry! The requested model has not yet been developed.
